# Code Book

The following describes each variable present in the file "ProjectData.txt" generated by running the R script <code>run_analysis.R</code>.

## Data collection and pre-processing

Data were collected as raw 3-dimensional signals from Samsung Galaxy S II gyroscope and accelerometer sensors.  Subjects were aged 19-48 years, and each subject performed all 6 activities<sup>1</sup>.  Time domain signals (variable prefix 't') were captured at 50 Hz and filtered to remove noise.  Acceleration signals were separated into 'Body' and 'Gravity' components through a Butterworth filter with corner frequency 0.3 Hz.  Jerk signals were obtained by calculating body linear accerleration and angular velocity.  The 3-dimensional magnitude of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements for acceleration and jerk were calculated using Euclidean geometry. A Fast Fourier Transform was used to calculate frequency domain signals (variable prefix 'f') for several variables.
